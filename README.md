My Portfolio Page 


This page is home to some projects I've been working on. My main aim in building this page was to convey the type of design that I like. 

**FAC note:** if you'd like to see my page as of 30/11/16, please look at release v0.1 (5a1694f). Updates since this date have been minor, addressing issues such as browser quirks. 

Thanks for looking at my repo!
